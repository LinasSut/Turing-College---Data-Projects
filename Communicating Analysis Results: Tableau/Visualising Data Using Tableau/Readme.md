# Adventure Works Sales Report
 In this project I received the Adventure Works Sales orders dataset, with several sheets where I can find Sales orders, Employees, Territory and Sales Reasons data from which I have to bring insights about how the business performs. 

So first of all I have few key business questions for which I need to provide the answers and bring as much insight as possible.

 #### The main questions I wanted to answer:
   1. How company performed over the year in revenue and number of sales orders?
   2. What are the trends of the orders received from each channel and which of the channels generates more revenue over the time.
   3. How commpany performing delivering products to customers?
   4. Which salespersons performed the best and brought more revenue and had the most sales orders over time?
   5. How much revenue and how much sales orders we received from each country and which country performed better?
   6. Which sales reason brought more revenue and had the most sales orders from online channel?

##### To answer these questions interactive Tableau report was prepared, which can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/linas.sutkaitis/viz/TC-GradedTask1/OverviewDashboard)

##### All the analysis steps can be found in the report, where all main questions and main insights are clearly introduced, which can be found [here](https://github.com/LinasSut/Turing-College-Data-Projects/blob/main/Communicating%20Analysis%20Results%3A%20Tableau/Visualising%20Data%20Using%20Tableau/Report%20-%20Adwenture%20Works%20Analysis%20.pdf)
